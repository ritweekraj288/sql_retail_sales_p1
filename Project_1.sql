-- DATA EXPLORATION

-- How many sales we have
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales;

-- How many unique customers do we have 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers 
FROM retail_sales;

-- How many distinct categories do we have
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS categories
FROM retail_sales;

-- DATA ANALYSIS & BUSINESS KEY PROBLEMS & ANSWERS

-- Q1:Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date='2022-11-05';

-- Q2:Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category='Clothing'
AND 
quantity>=4
AND 
DATE_FORMAT(sale_date,'%Y-%m')='2022-11';

-- Q3:Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category
SELECT category,SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale,COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1;

-- Q4:Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category
SELECT category,ROUND(AVG(age),2) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category='Beauty';

-- Q5:Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale>1000;

-- Q6:Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category
SELECT category,gender,COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category,gender
ORDER BY category;

-- Q7:Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year
SELECT year,avg_sale AS best_selling
FROM
(
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS ranking
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1,2
) AS ti
WHERE ranking=1;

-- Q8:Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
SELECT customer_id,SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(total_sale) DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Q9:Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category
SELECT category,COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cust_num
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;

-- Q10:Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)
WITH hourly_sale 
AS
(
SELECT *,
	CASE
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time)<12 THEN 'Morning'
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon' 
		ELSE 'Evening'
	END AS shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT shift,COUNT(*) AS total_orders
